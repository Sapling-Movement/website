# Sapling Movement

## Our world is broken

Take a minute to think of current events—it seems as if we‘re slowly transitioning into a dystopian future: Natural disasters increase in severity and frequency, entire species go extinct and the surface of the earth is heating continually.

Humanity is about to destroy their basis of life—our home, planet earth.

## Our Mission

In essence, Sapling Movement is about changing the current mindset. It‘s about putting the well-being of our planet in focus and reducing our self-satisfactory, exploiting interests.

Currently, Sapling Movement is dedicated to building a community that spreads awareness and develops ideas, how any individual can make a difference.

At a future point in time, it's ought to consult big corporations, giving advice on how to reduce carbon emissions and motivating them to act in favour for whats right instead of putting profit first.

## Philosophy

Sapling Movement is of positive nature. We aim to do our best at creating a lively world for all. We'll inform others about our work and with time, more and more people will understand the importance of our work and join us. We don't force anyone to be part of our movement–instead, people will eventually support us because it is our highest priority to find out what is right. We're pursuing to intrinsically motivate people, which by our understanding is much more effective than blaming people for certain behaviour.
